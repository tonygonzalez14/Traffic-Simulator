# Traffic-Simulator
This repository contains a C++ program that simulates a four-way intersection controlled by traffic lights. The program models different lanes, each with its own independent set of vehicles including cars, buses, motorcycles, and trucks. Each vehicle is capable of displaying its position within the lane and can move forward one space if certain conditions are met, such as no vehicle ahead and a green traffic light.

Key Features:

Object-oriented programming principles are applied to design the program. Inheritance is utilized to create vehicle subclasses with specific behaviors and attributes. Data structures are employed to manage and manipulate the vehicles and their positions.

The program incorporates random vehicle generation based on predefined conditions and probabilities for each lane. This adds variability and realism to the simulation.

By exploring this project, you can gain insights into:

Object-oriented programming concepts and implementation in C++. Inheritance and its role in creating specialized vehicle classes. Working with data structures to handle vehicle management within the simulation.
